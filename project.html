					<h3>KIHT project overview </h3>
                    <p> The <a href="https://www-shadoc.irisa.fr/kiht-kaligo-based-intelligent-handwriting-teacher-french-german-bilateral-anr-research-project/">KIHT 
					project </a> has the objective of creating an intelligent learning tool known as the "DigiPen," which is an electronic pen designed for digitized handwriting. STABILO, in collaboration with the German KIT institute, is responsible for developing the hardware of the electronic DigiPen. The KIT institute is focused on integrating artificial intelligence algorithms into the device.
					The IRISA IntuiDoc team is in charge of designing and developing the deep learning AI system that can reconstruct online handwriting patterns from the data captured by the DigiPen's kinematic sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and force sensors.</p>
					<br>
					<p class='first'> My contribution as an IRISA member </p>
                    <p> My work has focused mainly on the pre-processing chain for processing, synchronizing and labeling data (sensor and trajectory) to make it usable for deep neural network learning. 
					<a href="https://www-shadoc.irisa.fr/irisa-kiht-s-and-kiht-public-datasets/"> We collected a significant amount of data </a> using the latest generation Digipen. The pre-processing chain has been finalized. It is based on automatic alignment between ground truth (trajectory captured on digital tablet) and DigiPen sensor data (kinematic sensor) using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm.
					A neural network architecture based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) was designed and its hyperparameters optimized, and an evaluation based on Fréchet distance was implemented for optimum analysis of the results.</p>

				from very high spatial resolution images. </h2> 

				<h3>RemoteDeepMango project overview </h3>
				<p> Agricultural development in developing countries is crucial for poverty reduction and food security. This development involves deploying innovative digital solutions to acquire information on agricultural and cropping systems. In West Africa, understanding and modeling fruit chains is challenging due to a lack of suitable methods and tools for characterizing fruit tree-based systems, which are often complex (e.g., agroforestry systems).

					The RemoteDeepMango project aims to acquire data on mango production at the orchard level to inform regional production models. This will provide industry players with accurate and reliable information to meet their needs. The project requires the delimitation and classification of trees and orchards to provide additional input data to these regional models. </p>
				<br>
				<p class='first'> My contribution as an CIRAD member </p>
				<p> As a CIRAD member, my work has primarily focused on implementing deep learning neural classification and segmentation methods to produce cartographic information. The goal was to identify and map individual mango trees, whether isolated or in orchards, to improve the accuracy of regional production models. </p>
